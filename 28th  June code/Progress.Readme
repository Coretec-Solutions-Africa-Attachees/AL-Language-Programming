I designed and implemented an Automated Inventory Management system for this project using ERDs and process flow diagrams. 
The system effectively manages inventory levels, generates orders, and updates the inventory database. 
I created detailed ERDs to show relationships between suppliers, inventory items, and orders, and developed a process flow diagram to visualize the inventory management process steps.
